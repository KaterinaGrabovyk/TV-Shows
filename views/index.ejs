  <h1>Hi, I`m Katy ðŸ‘‹</h1>
  <p>
    I`m web-developer. I made this website for practice, using public api. Here
    you can see completed library of all TV shows(movies,series,cartoons etc)
    from over the world. You can view some primary information about
    each(cast,plot,status etc), and also visit source which includes all
    information.
